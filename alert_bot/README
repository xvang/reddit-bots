This bot targets a user and informs certain people (stored in a database "Subscribers") when that targetted user posted something.
The intended target user should be a bot, not a real user. 
It can be hosted on Heroku and uses postgreSQL.
The postgreSQL is also hosted on Heroku.
Everything required to run should be free(as of today 3/13/2015).
